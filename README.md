# Various Database Technologies

Examples of relational and non-relational databases in Java. The repository contains **five branches**, each demonstrating different technologies:

**ORM** - Hibernate for object-relational mapping of PostgreSQL data,
**MongoDB** - Non-relational database,  
**Redis**: Data store (cache),  
**Cassandra**: Column-based database,  
**Kafka**: Messaging and streaming.

All technologies are implemented using Docker and Docker Compose.
